# Integrating Javascript with your HTML


## Assignment Instructions:

* We will continue building upon the last lab aka your "About You" page!
* Create a Javascript file called "script.js" and import it into your HTML.
* Update your HTML form and add relevant names and ids to interact with your form and the submit button using the JS properties talked about on Monday and today.
* When you click on the submit button
* You should update its text to a circular loader
* Run that loader for 3 seconds
* Once the 3 seconds are complete, create an alert with a meaningful message using your form's input.
* Once the alert is stopped/closed, the button text should again become its original value.
